(fejwbe0)","In the modern world, most households depend on cash to some extent. When aid is given in kind, households are often forced to seek cash in ways that may be detrimental to longer term livelihoods, for example selling productive assets, or giving children to the care of relatives. (gttnlj7)",Injections of cash benefits the recovery of trade and the local economy. (3ptezdp),"By stimulating local markets, cash based interventions may benefit more than the direct recipients of cash. (mrqzggg)","The availability of cash gives households a sense of restored power over their immediate situation. In addition, there is evidence that receiving cash can at least temporarily empower women within the household. (k6xq688)","When goods are available and accessible locally, cash or voucher-based interventions have the potential to be more rapid than bringing supply from out of country. (z5r2gue)","When we give welfare in our country, we give money rather than food or any other specific item. We do this because we know it to work best. It is no different for those living in extreme poverty, they know best what they need and we should give money instead of specific items. (80w59j7)","One size does not fit all! Using cash recognises that beneficiaries are best placed to decide what their households need, and gives them the flexibility to choose according to their own diverse needs and priorities. (9rtarjo)","Rather than impose our ideas as to what people in extreme poverty need, sending direct cash allows the beneficiary to decide what they want.
